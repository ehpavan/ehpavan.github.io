# Breaking Into Web Security

I started my cybersecurity journey at a young age, exploring how websites work and how they break.

* Learned the basics of HTML, JS, and request flows.
* Discovered my first XSS and realized the power of ethical hacking.
* Slowly got deeper into Python automation and web vulnerabilities.

Today, I focus on building tools that **automate recon and vulnerability detection**.
